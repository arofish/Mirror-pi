This document describes how collaborators of this repository should work together.

## Pull Requests

- never merge your own PR's
- never merge without someone having approved (approving and merging from same person is allowed)
- wait for all approvals requested (or the author decides something different in the comments)
- never merge to `master`, except for releases (because of update notification)
- merges to master should be tagged with the "mastermerge" label so that the test runs through

## Issues

- "real" Issues are closed if the problem is solved and the fix is released
- unrelated Issues (e.g. related to a foreign module) are closed immediately with a comment to open an issue in the module repository or to discuss this further in the forum or discord

## Releases

- are done by @MichMich only
